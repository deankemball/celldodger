# celldodger

a game demo inspired by rogue (1986)

## installation

this is a `vanilla-ts` app bootstrapped with `vite`
clone the repo and run `yarn` to install packages
if you do not have yarn installed, run `volta install yarn`
if you do not have volta installed, run `npm i volta`

## dev

to start the dev server run `yarn run dev`
to start the tailwind compiler run `yarn run watch`

## maintenance

i will eventually add comments and clean up the code a bit further.
feel free to fork the repo and experiment with different styles,
game parameters, or the enemy ai.
